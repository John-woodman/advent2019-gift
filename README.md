**Congratulations on receiving your late Christmas gift from the OverTheWire
Advent Bonanza 2019 CTF!**


Without giving too much away to those who didn't receive a gift yet (this is a
public repository after all), here are some things for you to do:

1. Register your tracking code.

	This is the first time that we have collected addresses and sent out gifts via
	postal mail. As such, you are now part of a scientific experiment.  On the
	bottom-right inside the card, there is a unique 6-letter code that helps us to
	track which gifts have arrived and which have not.

	Please register this code here: https://forms.gle/T88DraQPAVMP8kh28

	In a couple weeks or months, we will compile statistics on the success rate of
	our postal mail experiment and release them here.

2. Use your gift

	Open a text editor and plug in the device in your computer. No worries, it's not malware.
	From there on, we're sure you will figure out what to do!

3. Keep giving by making your own gift.

	Once you figure out how to reprogram the device, we invite you to make some new
	firmware and upload it here (via pull request, put your stuff in a
	subdirectory) for others to play around with. Our hope is that we can get a
	nice cycle of community-made challenges going.

4. Send us a postcard

	On the back of the envelope is a return address. Please feel free to send back a postcard,
	we love to receive them! :D
