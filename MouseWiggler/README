This is an example of how little code you need to create something extremely useful.

At my workplace, I am using a Windows computer which is tightly controlled by IT staff.
Since I almost never use this machine, except for reading e-mail, it very often switches
on the screensaver and locks my screen (a setting I cannot change).

This handy firmware will wiggle the mouse just a tiny bit every 10 seconds, preventing
that my Windows computer goes to sleep.
