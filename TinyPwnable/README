The original plan was to create a tiny wargame that could run on the ATtiny85
and communicated with using the serial port.
Unfortunately, the hardware required for a straightforward implementation is not
present in this version of the ATtiny85 board (you need the Pro), which necessitates
the use of DigiCDC.
This code works and can be loaded on the board, but it turns out to be very flaky.
On some USB ports it will work fine, while on others it fails.

If you can get it to run on yours: have fun!
If you can figure out why it doesn't work, and you can fix it: please tell us!
